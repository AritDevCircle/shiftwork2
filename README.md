## About Shiftwork App

The Shiftwork App is a meeting place for shiftworkers seeking gigs and busines owners seeking an easy way to fill last-minute open shifts.<br />
The app is engineered by the fellows of Our Time For Tech's CodeCollab track. Through building this application, our fellows increase their competencies in the following areas:
- Technical and interpersonal collaboration
- Team communication
- Interpreting, managing & implementing project requirements
- Understanding and consuming technical documentation
